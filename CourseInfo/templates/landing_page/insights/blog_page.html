<p>Businesses across industries are increasingly recognizing the importance of data collection and management. From customer behavior analysis to market trends forecasting, data serves as the cornerstone of informed decision-making and strategic planning. The glaring omission to this focus on data: Training. 
Despite the considerable investments made into training initiatives, time and again companies fail to harness the full potential of the data generated through these programs. This not only undermines the effectiveness of training efforts but also represents a missed opportunity for organizational growth and innovation.
This observation has led us to call training the Black Hole of a companyâ€™s data plan. All the insights, knowledge, and expertise of the company is given to employees, but what they take away, what they do with that information, and, crucially, how that actually leads to a ROI is left to the assumption (i.e., hope) that something is better than nothing. 
Why, then, despite all the efforts to improve employees does training remain a data black hole?
Lack of Data Collection Strategy: Unlike other areas of business operations where data collection is prioritized and structured, training programs often lack a cohesive data collection strategy. Companies may conduct training sessions without clearly defined objectives or metrics for measuring success. As a result, valuable data related to employee learning outcomes, skill proficiency, and training effectiveness remain untracked and underutilized.
Fragmented Data Sources: Even when data is collected within training programs, it is often fragmented across disparate systems and platforms. Information may be scattered across spreadsheets, learning management systems, performance evaluation tools, and employee feedback surveys, making it challenging to aggregate and analyze effectively. This fragmentation impedes the holistic understanding of employee development and hampers decision-making.
Limited Integration with Business Objectives: Training initiatives are sometimes treated as isolated events, disconnected from broader business objectives and strategies. Consequently, the data generated from these programs fails to align with organizational goals, rendering it less actionable and relevant to decision-makers. Without integration into the larger framework of business operations, training data remains siloed and fails to drive meaningful insights and improvements.

Overreliance on Traditional Streams of Information: Training provides targeted information specific to tasks and performance expectations. Especially during the shift to remote work, many companies became over-reliant on weak indicators of employee performance such as active mouse movements and messages posted to Teams. Research has time and again shown that these indicators are uncorrelated with real employee performance, yet this information has been used in decision making and strategic planning. It truly has become a bad temporary solution made permanent.

Given the critical role of training in driving employee performance and organizational success, it is imperative for companies to address the black hole of data that plagues training initiatives. This can appear as a daunting task. Not only does it require a rethink in the way training is conducted, but it also requires a shift in culture that ensures that training is more than a requirement, but a part of the broader culture focused on supporting and developing talent.
Although this may seem as a huge lift, we excel in supporting companies shifting to a data-first mindset in their training and development. We find ways to integrate training with overarching business objectives by leveraging advanced analytics tools to identify, collect, and unlock the full potential of training data.
Continuing to ignore the data lost in training means missing invaluable insights into employee capabilities, identify areas for improvement, optimize training programs, and ultimately drive sustainable growth and competitive advantage. It's time to shine a light on the black hole of training data and harness its transformative power for the benefit of employees and businesses alike.
